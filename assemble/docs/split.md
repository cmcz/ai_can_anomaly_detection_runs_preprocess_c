# split

`split` cuts the logs into train and test. `split_rows` cuts the training rows into
train and calibration rows.

## Example

```python
seconds = seconds_above(logs, min_speed)
train_logs, test_logs = split(seconds, train_frac)

raw, t, seg = grid_rows(train_logs)             # from train_set.md
train_rows, calibration_rows = split_rows(raw, t, share, block, gap, min_speed)
```

## Train and test are sized by the seconds above the minimum speed

Only rows above `min_speed` are scored, and only they set the threshold. Everything
slower is left to the rules.

The truck is parked for long runs of consecutive logs, so a part chosen by log count
alone can hold no scoreable row at all.

So the cut is made on the seconds above `min_speed`. `seconds_above` counts them one
log at a time, giving 0 for a log the truck sat still through and the log's whole length
for one it drove right through.

## The calibration set

The rows that set the threshold must be ones the model never saw. A model with enough
capacity fits its own training rows, so residuals on those come out smaller than on rows
it has not seen, and a threshold read off them would sit too low.

| argument | what it decides |
|---|---|
| `share` | how much of the seconds above `min_speed` calibrates |
| `block` | how long one calibration window is |
| `gap` | the seconds either side of a window that go to neither part |

An event such as hard braking runs for seconds, long enough to cross the edge of a
window and land on both sides of the split. That is what `gap` is for.
