# change_limit

Flags a signal moving faster than the truck can move it.

```python
violations(values, previous, seconds)   # -> the names that moved too far
LIMITS                                  # -> {name: most it may move per second}
```

The caller keeps the previous reading and the time since, which is what separates
this from the rules in [instant](../../instant). Both arguments come from the same
place, a decoded frame or a grid row, one step apart.

The signal being read and the one step before it have to sit in one segment.
[evaluate](../../../evaluate) checks that before calling, so nothing is compared
across a break in the recording.

## Which signals

Only four have a limit worth setting. The wheels and the two speeds are held by how
hard a truck can brake, and the steering and the yaw by how fast a driver can turn.

| signal | limit per second | most seen |
|---|---|---|
| yaw_rate | 3.0 rad/s2 | 1.1 |
| steering_angle | 40.0 rad/s | 16.4 |
| wheel_speed | 50.0 km/h/s | 21.0 |
| tachograph_speed | 100.0 km/h/s | 41.9 |

The rest move too freely to bound. A shift lets the input shaft spin to 75,000 rpm
per second, the clutch slip follows it, and the gear number jumps several places at
once. See [measurements](../../measurements.md).

## Timing

The limits are measured between one frame and the next of the same PGN, so they
belong with a rule running at frame arrival. A grid row is a different span, 100 ms
holding whatever arrived within it, and the same signal shows a slower rate there.
Reusing these numbers on grid rows would let real jumps through.

Over 70 logs and 949,349 comparisons this fires twice, both on the yaw rate.
